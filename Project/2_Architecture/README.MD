# Functions of the components used
* TEMPERATURE SENSOR LM35
The temperature of the room is detected by the temperature sensor. This electrical gadget turns data detected in the environment into electronic data for the purpose of recording. Temperature sensors come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The LM 35 temperature sensor is used in this project. With an udeviating scale factor of +10mv/° C, the LM35 temperature sensor can work in temperatures ranging from -55°C to 150°C. It's a small, low-cost IC that can measure temperature anywhere in the environment between -55°C and 150°C.

* ARDUINO
The Arduino UNO is a development board that has a built-in microprocessor. It is a free and open-source programme. Arduino is a hardware and software platform for electronics that is simple to use. The Arduino boards can receive inputs and understand them, resulting in outputs such as light on a sensor, a finger on a button, activating a motor, turning on an LED, manually publishing anything online, and so on. Ardunio is a component of the majority of applications used in daily life. The reason for this is that the Arduino correctly interprets the instructions that we provide.What is the best way to send commands to the Arduino board? These tools can feed the instructions to the Arduino board: the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring) and the Arduino Software (IDE) (based on Processing).

* POTENTIOMETER
A potentiometer is an electric device that measures the Electro Motive Force of a battery, as well as the internal resistance of a cell. It's also used to compare the EMFs of various cells. In most applications, it can also be used as a variable resistor.

* RELAY
It's an electromechanical switch that controls (opens and closes) circuits. The main function of this device is to break contact using a signal without the need for human intervention in order to turn it ON or OFF. Its primary function is to regulate a high-powered circuit with a low-power signal.
