# Temperature based Fan Speed Controller
## Abstract  
This project, Temperature Based Fan Speed Control, can be completed with the help of an Arduino board and some electronic components. The Arduino UNO board is quite popular among all electronic circuits, so we used an Arduino UNO board to regulate the fan speed. The suggested system is designed to detect the temperature of the room and transfer that information to the Arduino UNO board, according to the proposal. The Arduino UNO board then compares the current temperature to the set temperature using the Arduino's built-in programme, which is fed through us. The operation's output is sent to an Arduino UNO board's o/p port, which is connected to an LCD display.

|LLR1|change the temperature in temperature sensor                  | 
|LLR2|Fan is OFF when the temperature with in the limit             |
|LLR3|Fan is ON when the temperature is higher then the limit       |
|LLR4|LED ON when the temperature is higher then the limit          |
|LLR5|we can see the varying tempature, and fan speed on LCD display|

# SWOT 
# Strength 

* it is very economical and easy to handel by the user
* speed varies automatically, so that it controls the speed without using it manually 
* it is help full to disabled people 
* it is very easy to install in offices, houses etc
* save energy by showing down its speed in low temperature 

# weakness 

* Arduino is the heart of the circuit, if controller is damaged the whole system will be interrupted.
* Speed control is independent of individual preference.

# 4w's & 1H
# WHO
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller can be used in both the home and Industry.

# WHAT
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller It helps in saving the energy and electricity.

# WHEN
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller Prevents waste of energy when itâ€™s not hot enough for a fan to be needed. To assist people who are disabled to adjust the fan speed automatically.

# HOW
The aim of this project is to design a temperature controlled fan using Arduino, in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature
