# SWOT 
### Strength 

* it is very economical and easy to handel by the user
* speed varies automatically, so that it controls the speed without using it manually 
* it is help full to disabled people 
* it is very easy to install in offices, houses etc
* save energy by showing down its speed in low temperature 

### weakness 

* Arduino is the heart of the circuit, if controller is damaged the whole system will be interrupted.
* Speed control is independent of individual preference.

## WHO
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller can be used in both the home and Industry.

## WHAT
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller It helps in saving the energy and electricity.

## WHEN
Temperature based Fan Speed Controller Prevents waste of energy when itâ€™s not hot enough for a fan to be needed. To assist people who are disabled to adjust the fan speed automatically.

## HOW
The aim of this project is to design a temperature controlled fan using Arduino, in which the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature
