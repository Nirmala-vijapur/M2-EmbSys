# Temperature Controlled DC Fan
## Description 
Temperature Controlled DC Fan is a system which automatically turns on a DC Fan when the ambient temperature increases above a certain limit.
Generally, electronic devices produce more heat. So this heat should be reduced in order to protect the device. There are many ways to reduce this heat. 
One way is to switch on the fan spontaneously.switches the fan when it detects the temperature inside the device greater than its threshold value.

## Functions of the components used 
## TEMPERATURE SENSOR LM35
To achieve the task mentioned above, we are going to use temp. Sensor LM35 as it is used widely and easily available.
LM35 has 3 pins
1. Vin-- this pin is connected to dc power supply between 4 to 20 v.
2. Vout-- this pin gives output in the form of voltage.
3. GND-- this pin is connected to gnd terminal of circuit.


LM35, when connected to power supply senses the temperature of surroundings and sends equivalent voltage in accordance with per degree rise in temperature through its output pin. LM35 can sense any temp. between -50 degree to +150 degree Celsius and increases output by 10 millivolts with 1 degree rise in temperature. Thus maximum voltage it can give as output is 1.5 volts.

## WHY ARDUINO FOR THIS DC FAN CONTROLLER PROJECT?
Arduino is required to change the analog value received from output pin of LM35 to digital value and sends the corresponding digital output (PWM) to the base of mosfet.
We will also use arduino commands to print temperature, corresponding analog value and digital output to mosfet on serial monitor of ARDUINO IDE.

## WHAT IS THE ROLE OF POWER MOSFET?
This circuit will be of no use if it cannot run high current motor. Hence to run such motors power mosfet is used.
The main principle of the MOSFET device is to be able to control the voltage and current flow between the source and drain terminals. It works almost like a switch.

## WHY DIODE IS USED?
Diode is used to protect the mosfet from the back E.M.F generated by motor while running.
Motors do have a blowback voltage, a back-EMF that is usually addressed by adding a reverse-biased fast diode, sometimes in addition to a capacitor, across the motorâ€™s supply wires. Without such protection, there is a high chance of this voltage destroying the individual GPIO line or more likely the entire on the Arduino.
