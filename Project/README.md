# Temperature Controlled DC Fan
## Description 
Temperature Controlled DC Fan is a system which automatically turns on a DC Fan when the ambient temperature increases above a certain limit.
Generally, electronic devices produce more heat. So this heat should be reduced in order to protect the device. There are many ways to reduce this heat. 
One way is to switch on the fan spontaneously.switches the fan when it detects the temperature inside the device greater than its threshold value.
